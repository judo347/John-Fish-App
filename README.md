# John Fish App

The app will be based on John Fish' idea about a Growth book. 

It will be a moving calendender with a trello look.

[OLD][TODAY][TOMORROW][2. may]

When the day shifts the not completed tasks from today will be move to old.

I whould like to use the app on both my android and multiple pc's.

## Shared data between devices
Use website to store saved data. Maybe pastebin, so that when program loads, it checks that file for updates. And when closses updates that file.
